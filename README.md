# My Personal Project

## VALORANT Match Recorder:
A system that displays and records all of your *VALORANT* matches

**Features**:
- Everytime you play a game, you can add it to your match history to keep a record
- You can enter the details of the match (what character you played and how many kills you got)
- You can enter the result of the match (if you won or lose and by how many points)
- You can calculate your average win rate and who is your most played character based on the games 
you have added into the match history

The X class represents each match of *VALORANT*. The Y class would be a list/collection of matches (the match history).
You can add an arbitrary number of matches into the match history 

This project is designed for gamers who play *VALORANT*. This project is of interest to me as gaming is one of my 
passions. I have been gaming ever since elementary school. Through gaming, I have made lots of long-lasting
relationships and it has helped me discover my interest in computer science. As a gamer, I think this project will 
be useful to track the matches I've played and to see my improvement over time.
